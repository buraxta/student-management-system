# Student Management System

This is a study aiming for making some practice with spring boot and thymeleaf.  
In this tutarial we learned basically;  
- How to map a request by using post/get Mapping,
- How to use JpaRepository for manupulate our datas,
- How to connect MySQL and how to configure properties file
- We use Service Layer instead of using repository directly,
- In HTML pages how to use thymeleaf properties (iterating datas, direct a link etc)
- And also using basic HTML and Bootstrap features.
